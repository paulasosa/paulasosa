            <h3>Guatapé</h3>
            <p class="text">
                A beautiful place, it is not described only with words, but I will try...
                <br /><br />
                Stone paths, colored houses, and figures on the walls, called "Zócalos", tell stories like the hieroglyphics of prehistoric times, but much more colorful, stylized, and protected.
                <br /><br />
                Exactly protected because Guatapé is one of those beautiful little towns that do not deserve to be changed or they would lose that colonial charm that accompanies it. It is an iconic place that cannot be missed by any tourist who arrives in the Antioquia area. Entering Guatapé is feeling like you go back in time walking through its streets, the church, the paths within the town, everything combines, everything makes every step you take unforgettable.
                <br /><br />
                Perhaps you have already traveled, a mountain, a forest, a long road of hours, but getting to Guatapé is not easy, and that makes getting there even more beautiful. It is a place between the mountains and the dam where many would like to travel often just to admire it, but some Colombians get to visit it only a couple of times in their lives.
                <br /><br />
                You can arrive by motorcycle, car or public transport, depending on your preference, but I warn you it is much better in your transport so that you can make technical stops along the way, not only to rest but also so that you can appreciate the beauty of the dam and take the photos that you like the most of the Peñol stone because on the way to Guatapé we find the town of Peñol, which has the great Peñol stone. Climbed for the first time, by Mr. Luis Eduardo Villegas López in 1954 together with his friends Pedro Nel Ramírez and Ramón Díaz between July 12 and 16 of that same year, for the challenge of a Parish Priest.
                <br /><br />
                It is popularly known that a challenged Colombian is like a whirlwind just released and this happened to Don Eduardo and his friends, today they are recognized worldwide and Colombians thank them personally I thank them for taking on this challenge, not giving up, and achieving that today, thanks to them, it is a tourist place by which Colombia is recognized abroad.
                <br /><br />
                After a certain age you not only appreciate your life, you start an internal discovery and this inevitably leads you to travel, it is very popular that this is within your homeland, to know your roots and Guatapé is this little lost world that you would like to visit every Weekend.
                <br /><br />
                I have had the opportunity to visit the Peñol stone twice in my life 2014 and 2022, the difference is abysmal:
                <br /><br />
                - Is the stone the same? Yes.
                <br /><br />
                - Is the road just as difficult? No, they did road reforms both to get there and to have a place available to park.
                <br /><br />
                - Did I like the changes? Not all of them, the parking lot is a very good thing, but they include restaurants on the second floors that cover part of the stone, so if you want a complete photo you should already be right next to the stone or go up to the terraces of these restaurants where you They charge to go up to take your picture. And I do not like that.
                <br /><br />
                - Would you go to the Peñol stone again? Yes, definitely. That rock is my biggest challenge, the two times I've been there I haven't felt able to climb it, so now I'm preparing myself physically and psychologically, if my dad could do it, I can too!
                <br /><br />
                The last question does not only apply to the Peñol stone, it applies to Guatapé and to all the places that I have discovered and will discover, beautiful places, within one of the countries with the largest flora and fauna on the planet, My beautiful Colombia. I invite you to discover it!
